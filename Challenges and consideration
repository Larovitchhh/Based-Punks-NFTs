Like any NFT project, Based Punks faces challenges. The NFT space is crowded with derivative projects, and standing out requires more than just a nod to CryptoPunks. The team behind Based Punks will need to deliver on promises of utility, community engagement, and transparency to avoid being labeled as “just another cash grab.” Additionally, while Base’s low fees are a draw, the network’s relative newness means it’s still building trust and adoption compared to Ethereum’s mainnet.
