The NFT market has seen its share of ups and downs, but projects with strong fundamentals and cultural resonance continue to thrive. Based Punks, by combining the proven appeal of CryptoPunks’ art style with Base’s scalable infrastructure, is well-positioned to capture attention. The lower cost of entry on Base could attract a new wave of collectors, while the project’s nod to NFT history appeals to veteran investors.Recent posts on X suggest growing excitement around Base as a hub for innovative NFT projects, with some users calling it “the future of accessible NFTs.” While specific data on Based Punks’ mint price or supply is unavailable (as this appears to be a speculative or emerging project), the hype around Base’s ecosystem indicates strong potential for growth.
