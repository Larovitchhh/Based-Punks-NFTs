The term “based” has become a cultural touchstone, particularly in online communities. It signifies authenticity, independence, and a rejection of mainstream conformity—values that resonate deeply with the ethos of CryptoPunks and the broader NFT movement. Based Punks takes this a step further by embracing the “based” philosophy, positioning itself as a project that celebrates individuality and freedom of expression in the decentralized world.The pixelated, retro-inspired art of Based Punks pays homage to CryptoPunks while introducing fresh elements tailored to the Base ecosystem. Think vibrant color palettes, new accessories inspired by Web3 culture, and even traits that nod to the Base blockchain’s branding, like Coinbase-blue hats or layer-2-themed backgrounds. These elements make Based Punks not just a collectible but a statement about the future of NFTs.
